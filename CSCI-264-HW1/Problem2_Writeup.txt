HW1 Problem 2 Writeup

1) Pseudocode
	Let n = the number of computers in the network
	Let S = the set of all connections	
		// This is the input
	Let L = an array of linked lists	
		// This is our adjacency list
	Let C = an array of size n			
		// This will store the number of connections
	Let T = an empty array				
		// This will store the results
	Let v = n							
		// The number of computers that still have connections
	For every pair (c1, c2) in S:
		Add c2 to L[c1]
		Add c1 to L[c2]
		C[c1], C[c2] += 1
	While v > 0:
		Find the index i of the maximum value in C
		C[i] = 0
		v -= 1
		Add i to T
		For every item k in L[i]:
			If i is not in T && C[k] > 0:
				C[k] -= 1
				If C[k] <= 0:
					v -= 1
	Return T

2) Running Time
	The estimated running time of this algorithm is O(n^2). At worst, the while loop will run n times, and the for loop inside it will also run n times with the worst input. Thus, with the worst input the algorithm will run n x n times, which is O(n^2).
